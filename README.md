This project is for have a simple [Helm registry](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/) and a web admin UI for manage registry.
There are 2 parts :
- **Backend** : Build in Go, API for store Helm package
- **Frontend** : Build in ReactJS, for Web UI to manage Helm registry

These parts are Docker images, that you use and deploy him in Docker env.

## Features :sparkles:
- Expose `index.yaml` file and `/charts/*.tgz` charts, according to the [Helm registry requirement](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/)
- **Chart Discovery** : Automatically insert/update/delete charts from the charts directory, in database and update the `index.yaml` file.
- **Chart Discovery** : Browse all `.tgz` files and open them to search file `Chart.yaml` inside, extract chart information and send this to the Database and updating `index.yaml` file.
- Customize the home page of the registry (`/`) with a CRD (`helm`) to describe your registry.

### Environment 
- [x]  On **Windows**
- [x] On **Linux**
- [x] On **Docker**, use the Docker image to deploy this registry on Docker env. You can use a Docker Compose file to deploy this (an [exemple here](docker-compose.yaml))

### Helm commands coverage

- [x]  **helm repo add** :  Able to add the registry in your Helm client
- [x] **helm repo update** : Update your client copy of your distant registry to be able to pull chart
- [x] **helm search repo** : Able to list all charts available in your registry
- [x] **helm pull** : Able to pull a chart from your registry to use it 
- [ ] **helm push** : Currently unable to push a chart into this registry (maybe in newer version)
- [ ] **credentials flags** (--pass-credentials, --password, --password-stdin and --username) : Currently any credential is required to use the registry (_in coming in newer version_)

## Get stated :rocket:

### Install from source code
> You need to have the corresponding Golang version installed.

Download the zip or clone this repository, and go to to `backend` folder. Execute these following commands

Download packages :
```bash
go mod download
```

Run the app :
```bash
go run .
```

### Install on Linux
Download the file `Helm-Registry-x.x.x_linux.tar.gz` from release artifacts in your Linux system.
Uncompressed the archive with the following command : 
```bash
tar -xzvf Helm-Registry-1.0.0_linux.tar.gz
```

> I recommend to uncompressed this archive in the path `/app/helm-registry/`. It's better to regroup all files in a same folder.

Adding permissions to execute the app
```bash
chmod +x helm-registry
```

And launch the app
```bash
./helm-registry
```

 After first app launch, that created some files behind the app (like sqlite db and `index.yaml`) and create (if not exist) charts directory (default: /usr/helm-registry/charts).

### Install on Windows
Download the .exe file from release artifacts and place it wherever you want. Execute the file and voil√† !
That create `registry.db` and `index.yaml`. So it is better to place it in a specific folder.

### Install on Docker
From image archive .tar, load the image :
```bash
docker load -i Helm-Registry-x.x.x_docker.tar
```

Run Docker container :
```bash
docker run helm-registry:x.x.x
```

With flags :
```bash
docker run -p 8080 --mount type=volume,target=/usr/helm-registry/charts,dst=/charts helm-registry:x.x.x
```
